### Local Environment

Create a file '.env' on your root directory to store your local environment variables.
This is a good place to store your secrets such as 'ACCESS_TOKEN' or 'CONSUMER_KEY'

These are the recommended env variables that you should set

```
PORT=<YOUR DESIRED PORT | NUMBER>
CONSUMER_KEY=<TWITTER CONSUMER KEY >
CONSUMER_SECRET=<TWITTER CONSUMER SECRET>
ACCESS_TOKEN=<TWITTER ACCESS TOKEN>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<TWITTER ACCESS TOKEN SECRET>
```
